# Rekonise

Utilize this python package to get the download links from a Rekonise url without having to go through the steps to unlock.  This was created out of frustration to access a simple file that was locked behind hours of YouTube videos that needed to be watched and subbing to 3 channels! 

## Setup

Install the required modules via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

You can use Rekonise from the command line to process links.

#### Example usage:

```bash
# Process links from a file
python main.py -f file_name.txt

# Process an individual link
python main.py -l http(s)://my-domain.com
```
